## Overview
This project focuses on developing a model capable of performing Question-Answering (QA) tasks across multi-category product reviews, encapsulating the model as an API to enable rapid Q&A through a ChatBot UI. <b><u>B</u></b>ERT-based <b><u>R</u></b>eview <b><u>I</u></b>ntegration with <b><u>D</u></b>ual <b><u>G</u></b>enerative <b><u>E</u></b>vidence (BRIDGE), as the core component of the project, excels in multi-turn, context-aware question answering. It builds upon BERT as a language encoder, incorporating a hierarchical memory layer to preserve contextual representations, and is equipped with a decoder that generates answers based on the question and contextual memory.
